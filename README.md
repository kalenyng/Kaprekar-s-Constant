# Kaprekar's Constant Web Application

This web application demonstrates **Kaprekar's Constant** (6174), a fascinating number in number theory. The app allows users to input a 4-digit number and observe the iterative process that leads to 6174, showcasing the steps involved in Kaprekar's routine.

## 📖 What is Kaprekar's Constant?

Kaprekar's routine involves the following steps:

1. Take any 4-digit number with at least two different digits.
2. Arrange the digits in descending and ascending order to get two numbers.
3. Subtract the smaller number from the larger one.
4. Repeat the process with the result.

This process will always reach the number **6174** in at most 7 iterations, after which it will continue to yield 6174.
